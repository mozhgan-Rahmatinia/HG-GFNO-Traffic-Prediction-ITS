HG-GFNO-Intelligent-Traffic

Welcome to the official repository for HG-GFNO, a novel intelligent system for long-term traffic forecasting in transportation systems. As presented in our paper, "HG-GFNO: Hybrid Staticâ€“Adaptive Graph Convolutions and Graph Fourier Neural Operator for Intelligent Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction in Transportation System", this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter efficiency, advancing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart city applications.
Current Contents
This repository currently includes:

Code: Python implementation of the HG-GFNO framework, including scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
Datasets: Preprocessed PEMS datasets (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08) used in our experiments.
Basic Setup Instructions: Initial setup guide for dependencies and environment configuration (see setup.md).

Future Updates
Detailed model documentation, architecture explanations, pre-trained models, and comprehensive evaluation instructions will be added upon acceptance of our paper in Advanced Intelligent Systems. Stay tuned for updates!

Why HG-GFNO?
HG-GFNO integrates hybrid graph convolutions and a Graph Fourier Neural Operator to model complex spatio-temporal dependencies, achieving a 10.9% reduction in RMSE and 11.9% in MAE compared to leading models. It offers a scalable, efficient solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities.
